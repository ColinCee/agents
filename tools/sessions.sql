-- Reads every Claude Code session transcript once into the temp tables that rule measures and the session table are
-- built from. tools/rule-tests.ts runs this file, then the user's own measures file, then exports.
--   texts(s, day, ts, uuid, txt)             each text block an agent wrote
--   calls(s, day, ts, uuid, tool, arg, bg)   each tool call: its command, file path or skill; bg = run in the background
--   typed(s, day, ts, uuid, body)            each message the user typed
--   sessions(s, day, ...)                    one row per session and day (UTC): project, model, effort, tokens, stamps
-- A measures file then makes chances(measure, s, day, ts, uuid, miss): one row per moment a rule could be broken.
